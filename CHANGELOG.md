## 0.11 (unreleased)
This release contains *lots* of breaking changes. These were necessary to continue Rspotify's development, and no more versions like this should happen again. Lots of internal code was rewritten to make Rspotify more flexible, performant and easier to use. Sorry for the inconvenience!

If we missed any change or there's something you'd like to discuss about this version, please open a new issue and let us know.

- Rewritten documentation in hopes that it's easier to get started with Rspotify.
- Reduced the number of examples. Instead of having an example for each endpoint, which is repetitive and unhelpful for newcomers, some real-life examples are now included. If you'd like to add your own example, please do! ([#113](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/113))
- Rspotify now uses macros internally to make the endpoints as concise as possible and nice to read.
- Add `add_item_to_queue` endpoint.
- Add `category_playlists` endpoint ([#153](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/153)).
- Fix race condition when using a single client from multiple threads ([#114](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/114)).
- Rspotify should now be considerably lighter and less bloated ([discussion in #108](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/issues/108)):
  + Remove unused dependencies: `base64`, `env_logger`, `random`, `url`.
  + Remove `itertools` dependency by using the standard library.
  + Remove `rand` in place of `getrandom` to [reduce total dependencies and compile times](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/issues/108#issuecomment-673587185).
  + Cleanup, reduced repetitive code and boilerplate internally in several places ([#117](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/117), [#113](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/113), [#107](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/107), [#106](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/106)).
  + Added internal zero-copy type for Spotify ids, reduced number of allocations/clones ([#161](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/161)).
  + Updated dependencies to the latest versions, integrated Dependabot to keep track of them ([#105](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/105), [#111](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/111)).
- ([#145](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/145)) Mark `SimplifiedEpisode.language` as deprecated.
- ([#145](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/145)) Derive `PartialEq` and `Eq` for models:
  + `Actions`
  + `AudioAnalysisMeta`

  + `SimplifiedPlayingContext`
  + `SimplifiedPlaylist`
  + `SimplifiedShow`
  + `SimplifiedTrack`
  + `TrackLink`
  + `TrackRestriction`
  + Fix broken model links refering to Spotify documentation
- ([#188](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/188)) Replace html links with intra-documentation links
- ([#189](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/189)) Add `scopes!` macro to generate scope for `Token` from string literal
- Rspotify has now been split up into independent crates, so that it can be used without the client. See `rspotify-macros` and `rspotify-model`.

**Breaking changes:**
- ([#202](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/202)) Rspotify now consistently uses `Option<T>` for optional parameters. Those generic over `Into<Option<T>>` have been changed, which makes calling endpoints a bit ugiler but more consistent and simpler.
- `SpotifyClientCredentials` has been renamed to `Credentials` ([#129](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/129)), and its members `client_id` and `client_secret` to `id` and `secret`, respectively.
- `TokenInfo` has been renamed to `Token`. It no longer has the `token_type` member, as it's always `Bearer` for now ([#129](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/129)).
- `SpotifyOAuth` has been renamed to `OAuth`. It only contains the necessary parameters for OAuth authorization instead of repeating the items from `Credentials` and `Spotify`, so `client_id`, `client_secret` and `cache_path` are no longer in `OAuth` ([#129](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/129)).
- `TokenBuilder` and `OAuthBuilder` will only read from environment variables when `from_env` is used, instead of `default`.
- `dotenv` support is now optional. You can enable it with the `env-file` feature to have the same behavior as before ([#108](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/issues/108)). It may be used with `from_env` as well.
- Renamed environmental variables to `RSPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `RSPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` and `RSPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` to avoid name collisions with other libraries that use OAuth2 ([#118](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/issues/118)).
- All fallible calls in the client return a `ClientResult` rather than using `failure`, which is equivalent to a `Result<T, ClientError>`.
- A real builder pattern is used now. For example, `Token` is constructed now with `TokenBuilder::default().access_token("...").build().unwrap()`. This has been applied to `Spotify`, `OAuth`, `Token` and `Credentials` ([#129](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/129)).
- The `blocking` module has been removed, since Rspotify is able to use multiple HTTP clients now. `reqwest` and `ureq` are currently supported, meaning that you can still use blocking code by enabling the `client-ureq` feature and a TLS like `ureq-rustls-tls`. Read the docs for more information ([#129](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/129)).
- The authentication process has been completely rewritten in order to make it more performant and robust. Please read the docs to learn more about how that works now ([#129](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/129)). These are the main changes:
    + `TokenInfo::get_cached_token` is now `TokenBuilder::from_cache` and `Spotify::read_token_cache` (using the internal cache path). Instead of panicking, the resulting `TokenBuilder` may be empty (and `build` will fail).
    + `Spotify::save_token_info` is now `Token::write_cache` and `Spotify::write_token_cache`. The latter uses the client's set cache path for the write. These functions also now return `ClientResult` instead of panicking.
    + `Spotify::is_token_expired` is now `Token::is_expired`.
    + `SpotifyOAuth2::get_authorize_url` is now `Spotify::get_authorize_url`, and it returns `ClientResult<String>` instead of panicking.
    + `SpotifyOAuth2::refresh_access_token[_without_cache]` are now `Spotify::refresh_user_token[_with_cache]`. It returns `ClientResult<()>`, and the resulting token will be saved internally instead of returned.
    + `SpotifyOAuth2::request_client_token[_without_cache]` are now `Spotify::request_client_token[_with_cache]`. It returns `ClientResult<()>`, and the resulting token will be saved internally instead of returned.
    + `SpotifyOAuth2::get_access_token[_without_cache]` are now `Spotify::request_user_token[_with_cache]`. It returns `ClientResult<()>`, and the resulting token will be saved internally instead of returned.
    + `get_token[_without_cache]` is now `Spotify::prompt_for_user_token[_without_cache]`. It returns `ClientResult<()>`, and the resulting token will be saved internally instead of returned.
- CLI-exclusive functions and  are now optional under the `cli` feature:
    + `Spotify::prompt_for_user_token[_without_cache]`
    + The `ClientError::Cli` variant, for whenever user interaction goes wrong
- Fix typo in `user_playlist_remove_specific_occurrenes_of_tracks`, now it's `user_playlist_remove_specific_occurrences_of_tracks`.
- ([#123](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/123))All fallible calls in the client return a `ClientError` rather than using `failure`.
- ([#161](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/161)) Endpoints taking `Vec<String>/&[String]` as parameter have changed to `impl IntoIterator<Item = &Id<Type>>`.
  + The endpoints which changes parameter from `Vec<String>` to `impl IntoIterator<Item = &Id<Type>>`:
	- `albums`
	- `artists`
	- `check_users_saved_shows`
	- `get_several_episodes`
	- `remove_users_saved_shows`
	- `save_shows`
  + The endpoints which changes parameter from `&[String]` to `impl IntoIterator<Item = &Id<Type>>`:
	- `audios_features`
	- `current_user_saved_albums_add`
	- `current_user_saved_albums_contains`
	- `current_user_saved_albums_delete`
	- `current_user_saved_tracks_add`
	- `current_user_saved_tracks_contains`
	- `current_user_saved_tracks_delete`
	- `user_artist_check_follow`
	- `user_follow_artists`
	- `user_follow_users`
	- `user_playlist_add_tracks`
	- `user_playlist_remove_all_occurrences_of_tracks`
	- `user_playlist_replace_tracks`
	- `user_unfollow_artists`
	- `user_unfollow_users`
  + The endpoints which changes parameter from `String` to `&Id<Type>`:
        - `get_a_show`
        - `get_an_episode`
        - `get_shows_episodes`
  + The endpoint which changes parameter from `Vec<Map<String, Value>>` to `Vec<TrackPositions>`:
        - `playlist_remove_specific_occurrences_of_tracks`
- The `Offset` type is now an enum to match API logic, `Offset::Position` is `u32` now (it's not a position in time, it's a position in a playlist, and you can't have both `position` and `uri` fields at the same time).
- ([#128](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/128)) Rename endpoints with more fitting name:
  + `audio_analysis` -> `track_analysis`
  + `audio_features` -> `track_features`
  + `audios_features` -> `tracks_features`
- ([#128](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/128)) Reexport `model` module to allow user to write `rspotify::model::FullAlbum` instead of  `rspotify::model::album::FullAlbum`.
- ([#128](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/128)) Split single `senum.rs` file into a separate module named `enums` (which is more appropriate compared with `senum`) with three files `country.rs`, `types.rs`, `misc.rs`, and move `enums` module into `model` module, which should be part of the `model` module, check [enums mod.rs file](src/model/enums/mod.rs) for details.
- ([#128](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/128)) Refactor all enum files with `strum`, reduced boilerplate code.
   + All enums don't have a method named `as_str()` anymore, by leveraging `strum`, it's easy to convert strings to enum variants based on their name, with method `to_string()`.
- Fix typo in `transfer_playback`: `device_id` to `device_ids`.
- ([#145](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/145))Refactor models to make it easier to use:
  + Changed type of `track` in `PlayHistory` to `FullTrack` ([#139](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/139)).
  + Rename model `CurrentlyPlaybackContext` to `CurrentPlaybackContext`
  + Change `copyrights` from `Vec<HashMap<String, String>>` to `Vec<Copyright>`
  + Add missing field `is_private_session` for `Device`
  + Change `PublicUser.images` from `Option<Vec<Image>>` to `Vec<Image>`
  + Add three missing fields `is_playable`, `linked_from`, `restrictions` for `SimplifiedTrack`
  + Delete deprecated field `birthday` and Add missing fields `product` and `explicit_content` for `PrivateUser`
  + Rename PlayingTrack to PlayingItem and change `added_at` to Option
  + Replace `Playing` with `CurrentlyPlayingContext`, since it's the same
  + Make `Device.id` and `Device.volume_percent`, since they would be null
  + Rename `Restrictions` to `Restriction` and move it to top level of `model` module
  + Rename `AudioAnalysisMeasure` to `TimeInterval`
  + Replace `start`, `duration`, `confidence` fields from `AudioAnalysisSection` and `AudioAnalysisSegment` to `TimeInterval` field
  + Remove useless `FullPlayingContext`, since it has been replaced with `CurrentPlayingContext`
  + Rename `CUDResult` to `PlaylistResult`, since this original name isn't self-explaining
  + Change `{FullArtist, FullPlaylist, PublicUser, PrivateUser}::followers` from `HashMap<String, Option<Value>>` to struct `Followers`
  + Replace `Actions::disallows` with a `Vec<DisallowKey>` by removing all entires whose value is false, which will result in a simpler API
  + Replace `{FullAlbum, SimplifiedEpisode, FullEpisode}::release_date_precision` from `String` to `DatePrecision` enum, makes it easier to use.
  + Id and URI parameters are type-safe now everywhere, `Id<Type>` and `IdBuf<Type>` types for ids/URIs added (non-owning and owning structs).
- ([#157](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/157))Keep polishing models to make it easier to use:
  + Constrain visibility of `FullArtists` struct with `pub (in crate)`, make `artists` and `artist_related_artists` endpoints return a `Vec<FullArtist>` instead.
  + Constrain visibility of `FullTracks` struct with `pub (in crate)`, make `tracks` and `artist_top_tracks` endpoints return a `Vec<FullTrack>` instead.

  + Constrain visibility of `SeversalEpisodes` struct with `pub (in crate)`, make `get_several_episodes` endpoints return a `Vec<FullEpisode>` instead.
  + Rename `AudioFeatures.duration_ms` to `duration`, and change its type from `u32` to `std::time::Duration`.
  + Rename `FullEpisode.duration_ms` to `duration`, and change its type from `u32` to `std::time::Duration`.
  + Rename `SimplifiedEpisode.duration_ms` to `duration`, and change its type from `u32` to `std::time::Duration`.
  + Rename `FullTrack.duration_ms` to `duration`, and change its type from `u32` to `std::time::Duration`.
  + Rename `SimplifiedTrack.duration_ms` to `duration`, and change its type from `u32` to `std::time::Duration`.

- ([#177](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/157)) Change `mode` from `f32` to `enum Modality`:
  + Change `AudioAnalysisSection::mode`, `AudioAnalysisTrack::mode` and `AudioFeatures::mode` from `f32` to `enum Modality`.
- ([#185](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/185)) Polish the `Token.expires_at`, `Token.expires_in` fields
  + Change `Token.expires_in` from u32 to `chrono::Duration`

- ([#166](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/166) [#201](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/201)) Add automatic pagination, which is now enabled by default. You can still use the methods with the `_manual` suffix to have access to manual pagination. There are three new examples for this, check out `examples/pagination*` to learn more!

  As a side effect, some methods now take references instead of values (so that they can be used multiple times when querying), and the parameters have been reordered so that the `limit` and `offset` are consistently the last two.

  The pagination chunk size can be configured with the `Spotify::pagination_chunks` field, which is set to 50 items by default.
- No default values are set from Rspotify now, they will be left to the Spotify API.
- ([#202](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify/pull/202)) Add a `collaborative` parameter to `user_playlist_create`.
